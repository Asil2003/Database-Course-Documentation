## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

| Feature         | Flat File Systems                 | Relational Databases                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Structure       | Single table or document (e.g., CSV) | Organized into multiple related tables |
| Data Redundancy | High ‚Äì same data repeated         | Low ‚Äì normalization reduces repetition |
| Relationships   | Not supported                     | Supported via primary/foreign keys     |
| Example Usage   | Excel sheets, simple data storage | Web apps, ERPs, banking systems        |
| Drawbacks       | Poor scalability, redundancy      | Requires schema design, setup overhead |

üìå **Summary**: Flat file systems are suitable for simple use cases, while relational databases provide structure, scalability, and consistency for complex data operations.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Roles in a Database System

| Role                     | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| System Analyst           | Gathers system requirements, models workflows |
| Database Designer        | Plans the structure (schema, relationships) of the database |
| Database Developer       | Implements the schema using SQL or a DBMS |
| Database Administrator   | Manages performance, backups, security |
| Application Developer    | Integrates database into applications (e.g., web or mobile) |
| BI Developer             | Builds dashboards/reports using data from DB |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Databases

### Relational vs. Non-Relational

| Type            | Examples              | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Relational      | MySQL, PostgreSQL     | Structured, uses tables and SQL |
| Non-Relational  | MongoDB, Cassandra    | Document/Key-value store, flexible schema |

### Centralized vs. Distributed vs. Cloud

| Type         | Description                                | Example Use Case              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Centralized  | One server handles all operations          | Small-scale apps, personal use |
| Distributed  | Multiple nodes across locations            | Real-time systems, IoT apps   |
| Cloud        | Hosted by providers, scalable & on-demand | Web apps (AWS, Azure, GCP)    |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Storage and Databases

### What is Cloud Storage?
Cloud storage allows storing data remotely on internet-connected servers, supporting scalability and backups for databases.

### Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases:
- Elastic scaling
- No local infrastructure needed
- High availability
- Examples: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, Google Spanner

### Disadvantages:
- Requires internet connection
- Subscription costs
- Security/privacy concerns
