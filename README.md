## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

| Feature         | Flat File Systems                 | Relational Databases                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Structure       | Single table or document (e.g., CSV) | Organized into multiple related tables |
| Data Redundancy | High ‚Äì same data repeated         | Low ‚Äì normalization reduces repetition |
| Relationships   | Not supported                     | Supported via primary/foreign keys     |
| Example Usage   | Excel sheets, simple data storage | Web apps, ERPs, banking systems        |
| Drawbacks       | Poor scalability, redundancy      | Requires schema design, setup overhead |

üìå **Summary**: Flat file systems are suitable for simple use cases, while relational databases provide structure, scalability, and consistency for complex data operations.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Roles in a Database System

Understanding who does what in a database project is crucial. Below are key roles and their responsibilities:

| Role                     | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **System Analyst**       | Gathers user requirements and analyzes how the system should behave. Acts as a bridge between users and developers. |
| **Database Designer**    | Designs the database schema including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints based on system requirements. |
| **Database Developer**   | Implements the design using SQL and DBMS tools. Writes queries, procedures, and ensures data is stored efficiently. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Manages the database's day-to-day operations: security, backups, performance tuning, user roles, and disaster recovery. |
| **Application Developer**| Integrates the database with software applications (web/mobile). Uses SQL or ORM tools to fetch and update data. |
| **BI Developer**         | Uses the data in the database to build reports, dashboards, and analytical models for business decision-making. |

üìå **Note:** In small teams, some of these roles may be combined, while in larger enterprises, they are often specialized.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Databases

### Relational vs. Non-Relational

| Type            | Examples              | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Relational      | MySQL, PostgreSQL     | Structured, uses tables and SQL |
| Non-Relational  | MongoDB, Cassandra    | Document/Key-value store, flexible schema |

### Centralized vs. Distributed vs. Cloud

| Type         | Description                                | Example Use Case              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Centralized  | One server handles all operations          | Small-scale apps, personal use |
| Distributed  | Multiple nodes across locations            | Real-time systems, IoT apps   |
| Cloud        | Hosted by providers, scalable & on-demand | Web apps (AWS, Azure, GCP)    |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Storage and Databases

### What is Cloud Storage?
Cloud storage allows storing data remotely on internet-connected servers, supporting scalability and backups for databases.

### Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases:
- Elastic scaling
- No local infrastructure needed
- High availability
- Examples: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, Google Spanner

### Disadvantages:
- Requires internet connection
- Subscription costs
- Security/privacy concerns
